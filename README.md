Unity DOTS: Conversion Workflow

In this episode, we create Entities using the "hybrid" Conversion Workflow for DOTS.  First we define a GameObject and then add a ConvertToEntity utility.  Data from the GameObject then gets transferred to a corresponding Entity at runtime. 

We can also define an EntityPrefab and generate many more Entities using our Monobehaviour script.
